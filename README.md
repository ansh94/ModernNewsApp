# Newscom
A simple and easy to use news app entirely written in Kotlin using MVVM architecture, Databinding, RxJava, Dagger.
#### Update - The app now uses the latest [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) Libraries and is built according to modern design practices.
 1. [Kotlin Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - For making network calls and running asynchronous code without blocking the UI Thread
 2. [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx.html) - For using Kotlin extension functions such as viewModelScope()
 3. [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) - To manage data for offline cache
 4. [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) - To run background tasks periodically for fetching latest news

The latest code is present in the branch [mvvm_coroutine_offline](https://github.com/ansh94/Newscom/tree/mvvm_coroutine_offline)
